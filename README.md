# PowerPoint Macros


## KeepMyNames
PowerPoint allows to give custom names to shapes. This includes placeholders on slide layouts in the slide master. Yet when you apply the slide layout
to a slide, the names are lost (at least on PowerPoint for Mac > 16). This is likely because the shapes are rebuilt each time you apply a layout and get
assigned the default placeholder name (e.g. text placeholder). 
However, the order of the placeholders on the slide always matches the order of the placeholders on the layout. Even if you reordered them manually before. 
Because of this, you can transfer the names from the layout to the slide.
